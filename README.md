# Text classifier project - Fake news or True?
This project was done on the course "Statistics" from University of Trento. The idea is to have an open project where we would apply the tecniques learned on the subject in order to propose a solution for a problem.

This is a summary of the report. The html of the full report can be found on this [link](https://sangoncalves.github.io/News-Classifier-FAKE-or-NOT/).

## Objective

Identify if is viable to use algorithms to classify pieces of news in order to enhance its confiability.

## Data

The data is composed by two labeled datasets, one containing "True" news and the other containing "Fake" news.

## Models analysed

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Naive Bayes

## Evaluation

| Model | Accuracy | 
|---|---|
|Logistic Regression|0.986 |
|Random Forest | 0.998|
| Naive Bayes |0.884 |

## Conclusion
